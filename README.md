# XamarinForms.SwippableBottomTabView
This is a Tab control based off Chris Riesgo's excellent Carousel View

with his point of direction of how to implement a Tab View

One caveat: this code is not very reusable, meaning it's not something you can drop into your project and it will work right away. You still need to do some work to integrate it into your project.
Also, there is no transiton of the tabs when swiping like View Indicator in Android. The tab will be changed after the swipe is in place.
